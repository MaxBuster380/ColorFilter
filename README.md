# OneShot-Color-Filter

OneShot is a game created by Future Cat.
In it, there is a character called "The World Machine".
That character's sprites are derived from another character's, with a certain color filter applied to it.
This project aims to make it possible to add that exact filter to any image.

While this project is under MIT license, credit given is appreciated.

Download the latest "OneShot-Color-Filter.jar" release, or run the source code in an IDE that supports Kotlin development.

You are then presented a window where you can :
 - load the image you want to work on.
 - apply the color filter
 - change the TV effect size
 - export the produced image.

Currently, you can only export to the same directory as the input image.

This project currently works on Windows, probably works on Linux operating systems.
